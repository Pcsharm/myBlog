    <p>Malala was born in the town of Mingora in the Swat. In 2009, at age 11, many people got to know her through a blog of the BBC News' Urdu language service. The BBC published translated writings about her life living with Taliban rule.

On 9 October 2012, Yousafzai was shot in the head and neck in an assassination attempt by Atta Ullah Khan, a Taliban gunman. She was given emergency treatment in Pakistan and then moved to Great Britain for more medical treatment.

On 3 January 2013, Yousafzai was discharged from the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham to continue to recover at her family's temporary home in the West Midlands.[5][6] She had two five-hour long operations on 2 February 2013. She had a titanium plate put over the hole in her skull and a cochlear implant so she could hear again.

  <p>In May 2012 David Trumble, an award-winning artist, made a cartoon of Yousafzai as a Disney princess as part of a drawing of other feminist icons that he had made into princesses that was in the Huffington Post.On 12 July 2013, at age 16, she made a speech at the headquarters of the United Nations, stressing the right to education for all and for human rights and peace and non-violence against terrorism and intolerance citing the proverb: "the pen is mightier than the sword". That October she was invited to meet President Barack Obama, Michelle Obama, and their daughter Malia in the Oval Office.[10]

She wrote a book about her life, I am Malala: The Girl Who Stood Up for Education and Was Shot by the Taliban, which was published in October 2013. The book was banned in Pakistani private schools.[11]

The Taliban have said that they still want to assassinate Yousafzai. She campaigned for girls rights and education. Many officials did not agree with her campaign.</p>

<p>On 9 October 2012, while on a bus in the Swat District, after taking an exam, Yousafzai and two other girls were shot by a Pakistani Taliban gunman in an assassination attempt in retaliation for her activism; the gunman fled the scene. Yousafzai was hit in the head with a bullet and remained unconscious and in critical condition at the Rawalpindi Institute of Cardiology, but her condition later improved enough for her to be transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham, UK.[8] The attempt on her life sparked an international outpouring of support for Yousafzai. Deutsche Welle reported in January 2013 that Yousafzai may have become "the most famous teenager in the world".[9] Weeks after the attempted murder, a group of fifty leading Muslim clerics in Pakistan issued a fatwƒÅ against those who tried to kill her.[10] The Pakistani Taliban were internationally denounced by governments, human rights organizations and feminist groups. Pakistani Taliban officials responded to condemnation by further denouncing Yousafzai, indicating plans for a possible second assassination attempt, which was justified as a religious obligation. Their statements resulted in further international condemnation.[11]

Following her recovery, Yousafzai became a prominent activist for the right to education. Based in Birmingham, she co-founded the Malala Fund, a non-profit organisation with Shiza Shahid,[12] and in 2013, she co-authored I Am Malala, an international best seller.[13] In 2012, she was the recipient of Pakistan's first National Youth Peace Prize and the 2013 Sakharov Prize.[14][15] In 2014, she was the co-recipient of the 2014 Nobel Peace Prize, along with Kailash Satyarthi of India. Aged 17 at the time, she was the youngest-ever Nobel Prize laureate.[16][17][18] In 2015, Yousafzai was a subject of the Oscar-shortlisted documentary He Named Me Malala. The 2013, 2014 and 2015, issues of Time magazine featured her as one of the most influential people globally. In 2017, she was awarded honorary Canadian citizenship and became the youngest person to address the House of Commons of Canada.[19] Yousafzai attended Edgbaston High School in England from 2013 to 2017,[20] and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in Philosophy, Politics and Economics (PPE) from the University of Oxford, where she was an undergraduate student of Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, in 2020.</p>

 <h3>About her child hood</h3>  
 <p>Yousafzai was born on 12 July 1997 in the Swat District of Pakistan's northwestern Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province, into a lower-middle-class family.[22] She is the daughter of Ziauddin Yousafzai and Tor Pekai Yousafzai.[23] Her family is Sunni Muslim[4] of Pashtun ethnicity, belonging to the Yusufzai tribe.[24] The family did not have enough money for a hospital birth and as a result, Yousafzai was born at home with the help of neighbours.[25] She was given her first name Malala (meaning "grief-stricken")[26] after Malalai of Maiwand, a famous Pashtun poet and warrior woman from southern Afghanistan.[27] At her house in Mingora, she lived with her two younger brothers, Khushal and Atal, her parents, Ziauddin and Tor Pekai, and two chicken.[4]

Fluent in Pashto, Urdu and English, Yousafzai was educated mostly by her father, Ziauddin Yousafzai, who is a poet, school owner,[28] and an educational activist himself, running a chain of private schools known as the Khushal Public School.[29][30] In an interview, Yousafzai once stated that she aspired to become a doctor, though later her father encouraged her to become a politician instead.[4] Ziauddin referred to his daughter as something entirely special, allowing her to stay up at night and talk about politics after her two brothers had been sent to bed.[31]

Inspired by the founder of Pakistan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and the two-time elected Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, Yousafzai started speaking about education rights as early as September 2008, when her father took her to Peshawar to speak at the local press club.[7] "How dare the Taliban take away my basic right to education?" Yousafzai asked her audience in a speech covered by newspapers and television channels throughout the region.[32] In 2009, Yousafzai began as a trainee and then a peer educator in the Institute for War and Peace Reporting's Open Minds Pakistan youth programme, which worked in schools in the region to help young people engage in constructive discussion on social issues through the tools of journalism, public debate and dialogue.</p>
